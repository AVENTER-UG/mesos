// Manages cgroups V2 device access state.

// In cgroups V2, device control is managed via ebpf programs, as opposed
// to the control files in cgroups V1. As such we lose the ability to
// checkpoint a cgroup's device access state via the control files, and
// we have to checkpoint this information ourselves via this centralized
// device manager.
//
// In addition, we always construct the ebpf programs from the cgroup's entire
// state, which we cannot keep track of via control files anymore. So we need
// the centralized device manager to manage the state and provide an interface
// to incrementally adjust the device access state for a cgroup and generate
// the appropriate ebpf programs.
//
// TODO(jasonzhou): Add checkpointing / recovery support in follow-on patches.
